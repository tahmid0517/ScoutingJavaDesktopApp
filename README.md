# ScoutingJavaDesktopApp

This is a custom application that FIRST Robotics Competition Team 5036 used during the 2017 season in order to scout other teams.
Admittedly, the setup process is weird, but the app was useful for entering and calculating data. I wrote this around December 2016/ January 2017.

If you're a robotics team that would like to use this, or you want to use this for whatever other reason, feel free to PM me.
